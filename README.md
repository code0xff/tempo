# reth x malachite integration
The goal of this app is to integrate the Reth execution library and the Malachite BFT consensus library to produce a “full” node prototype capable of both consensus and execution. This new reth node opens the possibility of building new ethereum based alt-L1 networks fully within the existing, battle-tested reth ecosystem of tools.
